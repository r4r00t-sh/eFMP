1.2 Scope
* Inward Processing: Digitization and registration.
* File Workflow: Drafting, compliance checks, and movement.
* Administration: Oversight, tracking, and intervention.
* Decision Making: E-signatures and final authority execution.
* Dispatch: External communication and file closure.

3. Functional Requirements
Module 1: Inward Desk (The Entry Gate)
* Input: Physical mail (paper) or Digital mail (email/API).
* Feature Set:
   * Digitization Engine: Interface to scan and convert physical documents to PDF.
   * Validation Checklist: Mandatory fields for signatures and dates before processing.
   * Identity Generation: Auto-generate a unique Document Number tagged with Origin, Timestamp, and Type.
* Tracking Permissions:
   * View incoming list.
   * Track movement of incoming files within the department.
   * Track movement of files originated by the department globally.


Module 2: Section Officer (The Workbench)
* Feature Set:
   * File Creator: Create new file from Inward Desk or Internal Instruction.
   * Drafting Editor: Rich-text editor for notes/proposals.
   * Attachment Repository: Upload references, precedents, and previous correspondence.
   * Consultation Router: Send file for "Parallel View" to specialized desks (Legal/Finance) without transferring ownership.
   * Compliance Validator: System prompts to check "Procedural Correctness" before forwarding.
   * Routing Logic: Options to Forward to Authority, Return to Desk, or Send for Consultation.


Module 3: Administrator (The Control Tower)
* Feature Set:
   * Global Department View: A dashboard showing every file currently sitting at any desk within the department.
   * Intervention Tools:
      * Withhold: Freeze a file's movement.
      * Force Note: Add a high-priority administrative note to any file.
   * Deep Tracking: View notes of all files originated in the department, even if they are currently in another department (Read-Only).
   * Audit Trail: Receive notifications when files exit the department.
* Constraints:
   * Blind spot: Cannot see notes added by other departments once the file exits their jurisdiction.




Module 4: Approval Authority (The Judge)
* Feature Set:
   * Decision Matrix: Four distinct actions: Approve, Reject, Modify, Return with Query.
   * E-Signature: Integration with digital signature certificate for final sign-off.
   * Bypass Protocol: Ability to "pull" a file from a subordinate desk directly to the Authority desk, skipping intermediate steps.
   * Routing Override: Can change the destination of a file regardless of standard procedure.
* Constraints:
   * Jurisdiction Lock: Cannot recall a file once it has passed the Dispatch stage (exited department).




Module 5: Dispatcher & Exit System (The Exit Gate)
* Feature Set:
   * Routing Engine: Automatically routes approved files back to the Host Department.
   * External Comms: Generates letters/emails for external parties based on the decision.
   * Closure Trigger: Marking a file as Closed triggers the Exit Notification.
* Exit Notification Automation:
   * Alerts the Administrator that the file has left.
   * Logs the final decision for audit.
  

4. System Logic & Constraints
* Heirarchy Locking: A file cannot move to Dispatch without a valid decision from the Approval Authority (unless withdrawn).
* Note Visibility:
   * Internal: Full visibility of all notes within the department.
   * External: Administrators can only see their own department's notes on files that have left. They cannot see the internal deliberations of the receiving department.
* Audit Locking: Once a file is "Closed" or "Dispatched," the notes and content of that version become immutable (Read-Only).
  

5. Technical Stack Recommendation (Preliminary)
* Frontend: React.js or Angular (for a responsive dashboard).
* Backend: Node.js or Python Django (for secure logic handling).
* Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data integrity) + MongoDB (for storing unstructured file logs).
* Storage: AWS S3 or Local Secure Server (for PDF document storage).
  

Module 6: Super Administrator (God Mode)
Role: The system overseer with rights that supersede all Departmental Admins.
6.1 The "Recall" Protocol
* Definition: The absolute power to withdraw a file from any stage in the ecosystem (active, closed, dispatched) back to a specific state.
* Exclusivity: This button is visible only to the Super Admin.
* Use Case: Critical errors, legal intervention, or stalled workflows.
* Logic:
   1. Super Admin selects "Force Recall."
   2. System snapshots the current status (for audit).
   3. File is moved to the Super Admin’s "Holding" desk.
   4. Super Admin re-assigns the file to the correct desk.
6.2 Global System Status
* Dashboard: A live view of the entire organization.
* Visibility: Complete transparency. No "blind spots" (unlike Department Admins who are limited to their jurisdiction).
________________


Module 7: Analytics Engine (The Watchtower)
Purpose: To transform file movement data into actionable business intelligence.
7.1 Volume Metrics
* Incoming Load: Real-time counter of total files hitting the "Inward Desk."
* Origination Rate: Counter of files created internally vs. received externally.
* Status Distribution: A segmented bar chart showing:
   * In Process: Files currently moving.
   * Pending: Files sitting untouched in an inbox.
   * Hold: Files officially paused by an Admin.
   * Breakdown: Drill-down capability by Division, Department, and individual Desk.
7.2 Time Analysis (Performance Metrics)
* Live Processing Time: A ticker showing how long current active files have been in the system.
* Historical Analysis: Trend lines showing processing speed over months/quarters.
* Desk Efficiency Score: Calculation of Average Time per Desk (Total Time Spent / Total Files Processed). This identifies bottlenecks (slow officers) vs. sprinters (fast officers).
________________


Module 8: Time Management System (The Ticking Clock)
8.1 The "Timer" Visuals
* Activation: The moment a file lands in a user's inbox, the timer starts counting down from the "Allotted Time" (e.g., 3 days).
* UI Requirement:
   * Option A (Battery Model): A green battery bar that drains to yellow, then red as time expires.
   * Option B (Clock Model): A countdown clock (DD:HH:MM) displayed prominently on the file header.
* Visual Cue: When 90% of time is used, the file card pulses or highlights to grab attention.
8.2 The "Red List" (Escalation Protocol)
* Trigger: When Time Left <= 0.
* Action: The file is automatically tagged as "Red Listed."
* Notification Triad: An immediate alert is sent to:
   1. The Host Desk: (Why is my file stuck?)
   2. Department Admin: (Your officer is delaying.)
   3. Super Admin: (System bottleneck alert.)
8.3 "Request More Time" Workflow
A strictly governed process to extend deadlines without ruining analytics.
1. Request: The current desk clicks "Request Extension" -> Selects reason -> Submits.
2. Authorization: The Originator (Host) receives the request.
   * If Rejected: Desk must finish immediately.
   * If Approved: The request is forwarded to the Super Admin.
3. Execution: The Super Admin receives the "Extension Approved by Originator" alert.
   * The Super Admin hits "Reset Timer" or "Add Time."
   * Result: The Battery/Clock refills based on the new allowance.

Module 9: Quick Action Interface
Purpose: To minimize clicks for common actions. These buttons appear on the main file processing screen.
Button
	Icon
	Action Logic
	Approve
	✅ Green Check
	Moves file to next hierarchy step (Forward).
	Reject
	❌ Red Cross
	Marks file as rejected; prompts for mandatory "Reason for Rejection" note.
	Return to Host
	↩️ U-Turn Arrow
	Bypasses all intermediate steps and sends file back to the Originator.
	Return to Previous
	⬅️ Left Arrow
	Sends file back to the immediate sender (one step back) for clarification.
	Hold
	⏸️ Pause Icon
	Freezes the file at the current desk. Stops the timer (if policy allows) or continues counting (if policy is strict).
	Export to Sheets
________________


Module 10: Unified Tracking System
Philosophy: "See what you are allowed to see."
* Search Bar: Allows searching by File Number, Subject, or Date.
* Permission Logic:
   * User: Sees the file status (e.g., "Currently at Legal Desk") but cannot read the specific notes written by the Legal Desk.
   * Admin: Sees status + timestamps.
   * Super Admin: Sees status + timestamps + content.
* Status Tags: Every file must carry a visible tag: ACTIVE, PENDING, RED LISTED, or CLOSED.


















DOCUMENT: SOP FOR TIME MANAGEMENT & ESCALATION PROTOCOLS
Module: Gateway Timing Engine Applicable To: All System Users Status: Draft Specifications
________________


1. File Classification & Default Time Limits
To ensure the "Timer" is accurate, every file created must be categorized. The timer is set per "Desk Hop" (the time allowed for one person to process the file), not necessarily the total file lifecycle.
Priority Category
	Color Code
	Standard Allotted Time (Per Desk)
	Total File Lifecycle (Target)
	Normal / Routine
	🔵 Blue
	3 Working Days
	15 Days
	Urgent
	🟠 Orange
	24 Hours
	5 Days
	Immediate / Court
	🔴 Red
	4 Working Hours
	24 Hours
	Project / Long-term
	🟢 Green
	7 Working Days
	Variable
	Export to Sheets
Developer Logic:
* Working Days Only: The system must exclude Weekends (Sat/Sun) and Gazetted Holidays from the countdown.
* Business Hours: If a file arrives at 4:55 PM, the timer effectively starts the next business day at 9:00 AM (configurable).
________________


2. Timer Mechanics (The Visual Interface)
2.1. The Countdown Algorithm
* Start Trigger: Timestamp when the file lands in the Inward or Inbox of a user.
* Stop Trigger: Timestamp when the user clicks Forward, Approve, Reject, or Return.
* Pause Trigger: N/A (Timers do not pause for "Hold" unless explicitly authorized by Admin).
2.2. Visual Stages (The Battery/Clock UI)
The visual indicator changes state based on the percentage of time remaining:
* Stage 1: Fresh (100% - 50% Time Left)
   * Visual: Green Battery / Normal Clock.
   * Action: None.
* Stage 2: Warning (49% - 10% Time Left)
   * Visual: Yellow Battery / Orange Clock.
   * Action: User receives a prompt: "File [ID] is approaching deadline."
* Stage 3: Critical (< 10% Time Left)
   * Visual: Red Pulsing Battery / Blinking Clock.
   * Action: Dashboard highlights the row in red.
________________


3. The "Red List" Protocol (Escalation)
What happens when Time Left = 0.
1. System Tagging: The file status automatically changes to OVERDUE.
2. The "Red List" Dashboard:
   * The file appears on the Super Admin’s "Bottleneck" widget.
   * The file appears on the Department Admin’s "Action Required" list.
3. Notification Logic (The Triad Alert):
   * To User: "You have exceeded the time limit for File [ID]. Please process immediately or request an extension."
   * To Host (Originator): "Your file [ID] is delayed at [User's Name] Desk."
   * To Admin: "[User Name] has 3 files in the Red List."
________________


4. Extension Request Workflow
Strict logic to prevent abuse of the "Request More Time" feature.
Step A: The Request
* User Action: Clicks "Request Extension."
* Input Required:
   1. Reason: (Dropdown: Awaiting External Data, Volume Overload, Complexity, Leave/Absence).
   2. Additional Time Needed: (Dropdown: +1 Day, +3 Days, +1 Week).
* System Check: The timer continues running (negative count) until approved.
Step B: Originator Permission
* The Host (Originator) receives a notification: "Desk [X] requests +1 Day for File [Y]. Reason: Complexity."
* Choice: Grant Permission or Deny.
Step C: Super Admin Reset (The Final Key)
* If Originator grants permission, the request lands in the Super Admin Action Tray.
* Action: Super Admin clicks Confirm Reset.
* System Logic:
   * The Timer resets to the new requested time.
   * The "Red List" tag is removed.
   * Audit Log: "Time extension granted by Super Admin on [Date]."
________________


5. Performance Analytics Logic
To drive the "Analytics" module defined previously, the system calculates scores based on these time rules.
* Efficiency Score: A calculation per employee.
   * Formula: (Files Processed Within Time / Total Files Processed) * 100
   * Penalty: Every "Red Listed" file reduces the score.
* Bottleneck Identification:
   * If a specific Desk has > 5 files on the Red List simultaneously, the system flags the Desk as a "Choke Point.
